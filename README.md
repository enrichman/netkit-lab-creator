Netkit Lab Creator
==================

Netkit Lab Creator lets you create, simply designing visually your network, your lab.conf and, in a close release, the *.startup files!

Here a demo: http://www.enricocandino.it/netkit/netkit.html

Just add your items one-by-one or specify the list of your devices.
The list must be compiled writing one device per line.

You can modify the device name directly and add/remove dinamically the interfaces.

Create connections simply dragging from an interface to another one and specify the subnet name with a double click on the connection.


Built with jsPlumb and jQuery
